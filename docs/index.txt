% Perl 6 Tablets: Table of Contents

These are the Perl 6 Tablets, a comprehensive manual, aiming to support
many different ways of learning. The content is nicely sorted and
indexed and many links allow you to follow your interest freely. For a
lightweight introduction, try [my Perl 6 Tutorial](#) or the Book
[Using Perl
6](http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?perl_6_tutorial) or
[Learning Perl 6](http://www.learningperl6.com/Chapters/). If that is
too easy, read [the specs](http://perlcabal.org/syn/).
